Good Morning Ed, 

This is Claude and we spoke yesterday regarding to the opportunities on your team. 

After the call, I realized it is really a mutual fit with each other after laying out everything we talked about. I believe I could be a successful team contributor and grow with the team. Right now, I am very leaning towards this opportunity, and I really hope to accept this offer as soon as possible without handling any uncertainty. 

I have also received the offer from Huawei with C$ 90,000 in Toronto, and BOA verbal offer going through approval, and very likely the Snap offer in the next few days. It has been very exhausting recently to dealing with these, thus I am very eager to settle with the first and the best offer from GS, so that I can move forward and keep learning. 

In terms of the offer, I would be very pleasant if my base could be increased by $10,000. Here are my reasons, 
1.	I am not planning to save much money at this stage, but I do hope I could have some spare money to invest myself education wise. 
2.	I hope I could be able to spend a little bit more to live slightly more comfortable and close to the office to focus on work, save time to study.
3.	If I were to leave my current employer, I could possibly lose my current year bonus + unvested stocks in total over C$ 10,000 

Let me know if you feel content with my justifications. I am very looking forward to join the team soon.
